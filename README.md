# Customer-Segmentation-For-Retail

The primary goal of this project is to identify distinct customer groups to better understand their behaviors and develop tailored marketing and engagement strategies. By analyzing transaction data, this project categorizes customers into meaningful segments to optimize business decision-making and drive customer satisfaction.

**Key Features:**
- Customer Segmentation: Group customers into meaningful categories such as:
- High-Value Customers: Frequent purchasers with high spending.
- Occasional Shoppers: Low purchase frequency and moderate spending.
- At-Risk Customers: Customers who have not made purchases recently.
- Behavior Analysis: Analyze spending patterns, purchase frequency, and recency to understand customer behavior.
- Actionable Insights: Provide actionable insights for designing targeted marketing campaigns.

**Dataset:**
The project uses the Retail Transactions Dataset from Kaggle, which includes transaction details like:

- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- ProductID: Unique identifier for purchased products.
- Quantity: Number of items purchased.
- Price: Unit price of the product.
- Date: Date of the transaction.

**Tools & Technologies:**
- Python: For data preprocessing and analysis.
  
Libraries:
- Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- NumPy: Numerical computations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization in Python.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning for clustering and segmentation.
- Power BI: For interactive and dynamic visualizations of customer segments and insights.
- Google Colab: Collaborative development environment.

**Methodology:**
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for analysis.
- Feature Engineering: Calculated metrics like Recency, Frequency, and Total Revenue value (RFM analysis).
- Customer Segmentation: Applied clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to categorize customers.
- Visualization: Visualized customer segments to interpret and communicate insights effectively.

**Outcomes:**
The project successfully segmented customers into distinct groups, providing actionable insights to:

Enhance customer retention through personalized strategies.
Improve marketing effectiveness with targeted campaigns.
Identify high-value customers and allocate resources efficiently.
